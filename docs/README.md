Construction of this server began in November 2020 and has been an intermittent effort until April 2021. At that time, the configuration of the computer used for the game was not very high, but it still achieved unforgettable results. It is really lucky that this archive can be preserved completely, and it is also a rare and complete memory of the three years of high school.

这个服务器的建造始于2020年11月，经历了断断续续的努力，一直持续到2021年4月。当时游戏用电脑的配置不是很高，但是还是取得了难以忘怀的成果。真的很幸运这个存档能被完整地保存下来，也是高中三年难得的完整的回忆。
